You can run a test of the timing for a 961 channel Ar-N2 calculation and a 1982 Ar-NO calculation as follows:

If you are running the timing test locally, then execute the command

hib_timer [filnam]

this will run the tests and extract the pertinent results into the file
/hib43/timing/time_output[_filnam]

where [filnam] is an optional name qualifier for the time_output file

if you are running the timing test remotely, then execute the commands 
   a.  command makehib arn2 1053
   b.  command makehib arno 2053
   c.  cd ../hib43/timing
   d.  cp Arn2_timetest.inp ../bin/progs
   e.  cp arn2_timetest.com ../bin/progs
   f.  cp Arno_timetest.inp ../bin/progs
   g.  cp arno_timetest.com ../bin/progs

then submit to your remote queue the job
   hib_arn2_1053 < arn2_timetest.com >timeout_arn2
   hib_arno_2053 < arno_timetest.com >timeout_arno

(note, the files Arno_timetest.inp and Arn2_timetest.inp must be available to your remote job)


when your job has completed, it will have written the files timeout_arn2 and timeout_arno on your local machine 
in the directory /hib43/bin/progs 

execute the command hib_timer -r [filnam]

the pertinent results will be written into the file /hib43/timing/time_output[_filnam]
