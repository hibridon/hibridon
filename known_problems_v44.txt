Known Problems - hibridon v4.4

Bah2p basis routine:  Bound calculations give results that are not a simple
     energy shift from previous calculation.  Problem in bound routine?

Bah2p basis routine:  Problems with computing cross sections.  If run
     program right after reading inpur file, get message NO OPEN LEVEL
     FOUND FOR COLUMN CHANNEL  3 IN PARTCR, and program aborts.  If,
     however, bastst is run first, then scattering calculation proceeds
     normally.  The resulting cross sections do need to be verified.
     Also, J12 is not checked in computing cross sections with the
     INTCRS command.  FIXED 3/2013

Bah3p, Badiat2p basis routines:  These may have similar problems as
     Bah2p.  BAH3P FIXED 3/2013

Pot_hcl_vibnew pot routine:  The eispack routine RS must be replaced
     with the lapack routine DSYEV, to be compatible with the ifort
     compiler and MKL library

Hypxsc, Tenxsc, Trnprt:  These modules not yet extended to molecule-
     molecule systems
