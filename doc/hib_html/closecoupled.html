<h3><center><font color=#brown >The Close-Coupled (CC) equations</h3></center><hr><h4><font color=brown >Introduction</h4><hr></font></font><bodyfont>The CC equations arise whenever one describes thescattering of systems with internal degrees of freedom.  These equationswere introduced into the field of molecular collisions in 1960 by Arthursand Dalgarno.[1,2] An excellent description of these equations and the rolethey play in the quantum theory of inelastic collisions is given in a review article by Secrest.[3]  In this Introduction we shall assume thatyou have a basic familiarity with quantum scattering theory and with the CCequations.<p>In the close coupled treatment of both scattering and photodissociation, the scattering wavefunctionis expanded in a complete set of internal states of the system, usually constructedas direct products of the internal states of one (or both) fragments, multiplied byangular functions which describe the rotation of one collision partner about the other.Let us designate these internal states as <img src=phi12.gif>(<b><i>r</i></b>),where <b><i>r</i></b> designates the internal coordinates.  Each internal state is calleda <i>channel</i>.  In the Hibridon<font size=-2><sup>TM</sup></font> code, the channels are labelled by two integer indices, arotational angular momentum (contained in the array <a href=jout.html>JOUT</a>) and an additional quantum number or index (contained in the array <a href=indout.html>INDOUT</a>). <p>The full scattering wavefunctionis written as<p><center><img src=psi12.gif>(<b><i>R</i></b>, <b><i>r</i></b>) = <img src=sigma18.gif> <b>F</b>(<b><i>R</i></b>) <tt>x</tt> <img src=phi12.gif>(<b><i>r</i></b>)&#160;&#160;(1)<p></center>  Each column of the <b>F</b>(<b><i>R</i></b>) matrix definesthe expansion coefficients for collisions in which the collision partners start out in theparticular initial state whose index is that of the selected column.<p>Substitution of the expansion (1) into the Schr&ouml;dinger equation, premultiplication by one of theinternal states, and integration over <i><b>r</i></b> gives rise to a set of coupledordinary differential equations for the expansion coefficients <b>F</b>(<b><i>R</i></b>).<p>The general structure of these coupled second-orderdifferential equations is expressed by the matrix equation<p><center>	[<b>1</b> <img src=partialderiv12.gif height=8 width=4 align=bottom><sup>2</sup>/<img src=partialderiv12.gif height=8 width=4 align=bottom><i>R</i><sup>2</sup>  + <b>W</b>(<i>R</i>)] <b>F</b>(<i>R</i>) = 0 .&#160;&#160;(2)	</center><p>Here <b>1</b> designates the identity matrix, <i>R</i> is the interparticledistance, and the matrix <b>W</b>(<i>R</i>) is given by<p><center> <b>W</b>(<i>R</i>) = <b><i>k</i></b><sup>2</sup> - <b><i>l</i></b><sup>2</sup> - (2 <i>m / h</i><sup>2</sup> ) <b>V</b>(<i>R</i>),&#160;&#160;(3)  </center><p>where <i>h</i> designates Planck's constant divided by 2<img src=pi12.gif height=7 width=6 align=bottom>, <i>m</i> is the reduced massof the collision system and <b><i>k</i></b><sup>2</sup> and <b><i>l</i></b><sup>2</sup>  designate, respectively, the(diagonal) matrices of the wavevector and the relative orbital angularmomentum of the collision partners. We have<p><center>			(<n><i>k</i></n><sup>2</sup>)<sub><i>ii</sub></i> = (2 <i>m / h</i><sup>2</sup> ) (<i>E - e<sub>i</i></sub>) ,&#160;&#160;(4)			</center><p>where <i>E</i> is the total energy and <i>e<sub>i</sub></i> is the internal energy of the <i>i<sup>th</sup></i>channel.  Also, we have<p><center>(<i>l</i><sup>2</sup>)<sub><i>ii</sub></i> = (<i>h</i><sup>2</sup>/2 <i>mR</i><sup>2</sup>) <i>l<sub>i</sub></i> (<i>l</i><sub><i>i</sub></i> + 1) ,&#160;&#160;(5)</center>		<p>where <i>l<sub>i</sub></i> is the relative orbital angular momentum in the <i>i<sup>th</sup></i> channel.  InEq. (3) the matrix <b>V</b>(<i>R</i>) is the (full, symmetric) matrix of the couplingpotential.<p>Diagonalization of the <b>W</b>(<i>R</i>) matrix yields thediagonal matrix of  adiabatic wavevectors <i><b>k</b>(R)</i>.  The eigenvectors define the locally adiabaticstates, which are transformations of the internalstates used to expand the scattering wavefunction, <img src=phi12.gif>(<b><i>r</i></b>).If <b>C</b><i>(R)</i> designates the matrix of eigenvectors, columnordered, then the diagonal matrix of adiabatic energies is defined as<p><center><i><b>e</b>(R)</i> = <b>C</b><i>(R)</i><sup>T</sup> <b>V</b><i>(R)</i> <b>C</b><i>(R)</i> .&#160;&#160;(6)			</center><p>One obtains numerically the matrix of solutions <b>F</b>(<i>R</i>) by outward propagation.You start this propagation at a value of the interparticle distance <i>R = R<sub>start</sub></start></i> whichlies well inside the innermost classical turning point.  Once you havepropagated <b>F</b>(<i>R</i>) out to a value of <i>R</i> which is so large that the potential<b>V</b>(<i>R</i>) is negligible, compared to the wavevectors <b><i>k</i></b><sup>2</sup>, you can then match<b>F</b>(<i>R</i>) to the known <a href=boundary.html>asymptotic form</a> and obtain the <i>S</i> matrix.  This has to bedone over and over at many values of the total angular momentum <i>J<sub>tot</sub></i>.  In asemiclassical description the total angular momentum corresponds to theimpact parameter <i>b</i>. From the <i>S</i> matrix at all these values of <i>J<sub>tot</sub></i>, you cancalculate differential and integral cross sections.[2,3]<hr><h4><font color=brown>Cross Sections</h4></font><hr>	Within the CC formulation, the integral cross section for a transition from an initial state<i>i</i> to a final state <i>f</i> is given by<p><center><img src=ccxsec.gif width=174 height=38 align=center>  (7)</center><p><br>where<i>k<sub>i</sub></i> is the wavevector of the initial state and the sumruns over:<ul>all values of the total angular momentum for which the <i>S</i> matrix elements differ from unity.<img src=cautionsmall.gif>  You must ensure that the parameter <a href="jtot1.html">JTOT2</a> hasbeen set large enough so that increasing its value will not significantly changethe  cross section(s) of interest<p>all values of the orbital angular momentum <i>l</i> allowed by the triangular rule<p>both values (<i>p</i> = +1 and -1) of the total parity of the scattering wavefunction.  The total parity is related to the important input parameter <tt><a href="jlpar.html">JLPAR</a></tt>.  <img src=cautionsmall.gif>Notethat for full close-coupled determinations of either integral or differential cross sections, the calculations must be carried out for both values of <tt><a href="jlpar.html">JLPAR</a></tt>.<p></ul><p>Here, the <i>T</i> or <i>transition</i> matrix is defined as<p><center><i><b>T</i></b> = <b>1</b> - <i><b>S</i></b>,&#160;&#160;(8)</center><p>where <b>1</b> is the unit matrix.  At large <i>J<sub>tot</sub></i> the <i>T</i> matrix goes to zero as the centrifugal potentialbecomes so large that the colliding particles are kept beyond the range of the interactionpotential.  This defines the range of total angular momentum for which scattering calculationsneed be done. The minimum and maximum values of the total angular momentum for which the calculation isdone are set by the parameters <tt><a href="jtot1.html">JTOT1</a></tt> and <tt><a href="jtot1.html">JTOT2</a></tt>, respectively. <p>See Refs. 1 and 2 for an expression for the differential cross section equivalent to Eq. (7).<p>In general, the CC equations are block diagonal in the overall parity of the scattering wavefunction.  To obtain integral and/or differential cross sections it is necessary to carry out calculationsfor both values of this parity (this is ensured by setting <tt><a href="jlpar.html">JLPAR</a>=0</tt>; see the <a href=jlpar.html>JLPAR</a> frame for more information).<p>Equation (7) can be written equivalently in terms of partial cross sections<p><center><img src=ccpartialxsec1.gif width=97 height=33 align=center>  (9)</center><p>where the partial cross sections, which can be calculated with the command <a href="partc.html">PARTC</a>, are defined by<p><center><img src=ccpartialxsec2.gif width=165 height=37 align=center>  (10)</center><p>In a semiclassical formulation, the integral cross section is written as<center><img src=scxsec.gif width=134 height=41 align=center>  (11)</center><p>in terms of a transition probability which depends on the impact parameter <i>b</i>.  Thepartial cross section is thus equivalent to this semi-classical transition probability, as follows:<center><img src=scpxsec.gif width=123 height=24 align=center>  (12)</center><p><hr><h4><font color=brown>Wavefunction and Fluxes</h4></font><hr>	In addition to the determination of cross sections, which depend on the asymptotic formof the expansion coefficients <b>F</b>(<b><i>R</i></b>) in Eq. (1), the Hibridon<font size=-2><sup>TM</sup></font> code allows you determine the <i>R</i> dependenceof these coefficients.  In addition, one can also determine the <i>flux</i> associatedwith the scattering and photodissociation wavefunctions, which is a more meaningfulphysical quantity.

These algorithms can be grouped into two categories[3]:<ol><li><i>Solution-following methods</i>.  In these methods you approximate the	matrix of solutions <b>F</b>(<i>R</i>) by a power series and then solve Eq. (1)	exactly. This is similar in spirit to the usual numerical        techniques for solution of ordinary differential equations	(Runge-Kutta, Euler, Adams-Moulton).<li><i>Potential-following methods</i>. In these methods  the	matrix <b>V</b>(<i>R</i>) is approximated by a sequence of constant or linear segments.  In these	local regions the approximated CC equations can be solved exactly.</ol><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;In solution-following methods the solution is approximated while thepotential is retained exactly.  On the other hand, in potential-followingmethods the potential is approximated but the solution (to this approximatepotential) is exact.<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;No one method is superior at all values of the internuclearseparation.  Rather, it is best to combine a solution-following method atshort-range (<i>R</i> small), where most intermolecular potentials vary rapidly,with a potential-following method at longer range, where the potentialvaries more slowly but where for many problems the solution can be highlyoscillatory. This combination of two methods is called a hybrid integrator.<p>	&#160;&#160;&#160;The <a href=hibhelp.html>Hibridon<font size=-2><sup>TM</sup></font> hypertext help</a> describes a particular hybrid integrator - theHibridon<font size=-2><sup>TM</sup></font> program package.The solution following method used at short range is based onthe log-derivative propagator of Johnson,[6-8] as modified recently byManolopoulos.[9]  This propagator is designated LOGD.  The potential-following method used at long-range isbased on the linear-reference potential of Gordon,[10,11] as modifiedrecently by Alexander and Manolopoulos.[12,13] This propagtor is designated AIRY.  The Hibridon<font size=-2><sup>TM</sup></font> code combinesthese two  fast algorithms (LOGD and AIRY).  Both are fast and exceptionally stable. To a large degree the numerical stability is obtainedby propagation of the logarithmic derivative of the solution matrix <b>F</b>(<i>R</i>),namely<p><center>		 	<b>Y</b>(<i>R</i>) = <b>F</b>&#180;(<i>R</i>)<b>F</b>(<i>R</i>)<sup>-1</sup> . </center><p>rather than the solution matrix itself.<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;Another, powerful program packagefor the solution of the close coupled equations is the <a href=http://www.giss.nasa.gov/tools/molscat/>MOLSCAT</a>code developed by S. Green and maintained by J. Hutson.<hr><h4><font color=brown>References</h4></font><hr><font size=-1>1. A. Arthurs and A. Dalgarno, Proc. Roy. Soc.
