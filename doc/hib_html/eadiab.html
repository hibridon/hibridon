<TITLE>eadiab</TITLE><h3><center><font color=#brown >Command EADIAB</h3></center></font><hr>The command EADIAB  requests the determination of the adiabatic energies as a functionof <i>R</i>.  These are defined by Eq. (6) of the help link which summarizesthe <a href=closecoupled.html>close coupling</a> method. <p>    The command line syntax is<tt><ul>            EADIAB,{jobname}</tt></ul>where<ul>       <tt>{jobname}:</tt>&#160; the jobname under which the wavefunction informationfrom the previous run is stored, as the file <tt>{jobname}.wfu</tt><br> <img src=warningsmall.gif> In order to create the <tt>{jobname}.wfu</tt> file, the previous run must havebeen done with the flags <a href=wavefl.html>WAVEFL</a> and <a href=airyfl.html>AIRYFL</a>both set .TRUE.  </ul>The only adiabatic energies which are written out are those which correlate adiabaticallyat large R with the internal states of the collision partners whose rotational angular momenta and additional indices are specified in the arrays <a href=jout.html>JOUT</a> and <a href=indout.html>INDOUT</a>.  Specifically, adiabatic energies are given for each channel forwhich<tt><ul>            J(i) = JOUT(i)</ul></tt>and for which the vector element <tt>INDOUT(i)</tt> corresponds to the quantumnumber L and the extra index of the desired channel packed into asingle array as follows:<tt><ul>         INDOUT(i) = sign[IND(i)] x [100 L(i) + | IND(i) | ] </ul></tt><p>The asymptotic energy ordering of the internal states can be determined byrunning with the flag <a href=bastst.html>BASTST</a> set .TRUE.<p><img src=warningsmall.gif> The adiabatic energies are determined at all values of <i>R</i> lyingbetween <a href=rendld.html>RENDLD</a> and <a href=rendld.html>RENDAI</a>, with thegrid size and spacing controlled by the same parameters which govern the AIRY integration, namely<a href=spac.html>SPAC</a>, <a href=fstfac.html>FSTFAC</a>, <a href=tolai.html>TOLAI</a>, and <a href=tolai.html>RINCR</a>.<p><img src=warningsmall.gif> Highly localized avoided crossings of the adiabaticcurves often occur.  Use of a fine grid in <i>R</i> is the only way to interpret properly the adiabatic energies in these cases.<hr>Go to:<center><br><a href=commands.html>Commands</a> | <a href=eadiab.ex.html> An example of this command | <a href=examples.html>Examples</a> | <a href=hibhelp.html>Hibridon Help</a><br></center>
