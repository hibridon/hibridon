<TITLE>nerg</TITLE><h3><center><font color=#brown >Parameter NERG</h3></center></font><hr> NERG is the number of total energies at which the calculation is tobe performed.  Both the log-derivative and AIRY propagation aresignificantly faster for the second and subsequent energies.  Thus if crosssections are desired over a range of energies, it is advantageous to setNERG > 1.<p>The maximum value of NERG is controlled by a PARAMETER statement in thesubroutine LOGAIR (himain.f)and can not exceed 25 (because of restrictions imposed by the length ofthe names of the logical units reserved for storing the partial andintegral cross sections and selected <i>S</i>-matrix elements).  If NERG>1, thenthree scratch files (units 10-12) are opened to store the required energyindependent matrices as well as the channel quantum numbers. <p>The value of NERG can be changed with the command<p><ul><tt>           NERG={newvalue}<p></ul></tt> If <tt>{newvalue}</tt> is larger than the value of NERG currently stored, then youwill be warned to increase accordingly the array of energies at which thecalculations are to be performed.  This can be done with the command<p><ul><tt>           ENERG={energy1},{energy2}...{energyn}\<p></ul></tt> where <tt>n</tt> is the new value of NERG.  The string of input values <b>must</b> beterminated with a backslash if other input occurs on the same line.<p>Alternatively, you can specify a grid of collision energies b the command <ul><p><tt>           ENERG = {negative number},{energy1},{energ2},{nerg} </tt></ul><p>where<ul><li><tt>energy1</tt>:  The initial energy<p><li><tt>energy2</tt>:  The final energy<p><li><tt>nerg</tt>:  The number of energies (less than or equal to 25)</ul>The spacing for the grid of energies is determined as<ul><tt>delta_e=(energ2-energ1)/nerg</tt></ul>This spacing is then rounded to the nearest 0.01 cm<sup>-1</sup>, so that the final energybecomes<ul><tt>e_final=e_initial + (nerg-1)*delta_e</tt></ul>which may not be exactly equal to the final energy which you initially specified.<hr>In all cases, the energy values are reordered in decreasing order, starting with the highest value.<hr><a href=hibhelp.html><img src=up_arrow.gif border=0 align=middle></a>&#001;Return to <a href=hibhelp.html>Hibridon Help</a>
