If that keyword has sublevels, you will see a list ofadditional keywords.<p>For an introduction to Close-Coupled methods for inelastic scattering, followthe keyword <tt>INTRO</tt> <p>Execution of the Hibridon package is controlled by the Hibridon driver.For a description of the commands to the driver, see the keyword COMMANDS <p>The scattering calculation is controlled by<ul>   system independent parameters (see keyword PARAMS)<br>  system dependent parameters (see keyword SYSTEM)<br>  logical flags (see keyword FLAGS)<br>  input, output, and job names (see keyword FILES)<br></ul> Information on the system dependent BASIS, POT, and SYSDAT subroutinescan be obtained by entering SYSTEM and the appropriate keyword. <p>The keywords at level 1 are:  <ul><tt>HELP, INTRO, COMMANDS, PARAMS, SYSTEM,<br>                              FLAGS, FILES, LINKING<br></tt></ul><p>To get information on keywords at level 2, you can also type &#147;helpkeyword&#148;.
