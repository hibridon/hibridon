<TITLE>tolai</TITLE><h3><center><font color=#brown >Parameters TOLAI and RINCR</h3></center></font><hr>The key parameters TOLAI and RINCR control the interval size in the AIRY propagation.<p>Whenever <i>R</i> < RINCR, then <b>no</b> change is allowed in the interval size.<p>If, however, <i>R</i> > RINCR andTOLAI is .ge. 1, then the width of the next interval is set to be aconstant multiple of the present interval size, namely<p> <tt><center>      DRNOW(n+1) = DRNOW(n) * TOLAI<p> </tt></center> Thus, to ensure constant step sizes in the AIRY propagation, set TOLAI = 1.By setting TOLAI > 1, the interval sizes will be monotonicallyincreasing, so that you will use larger step sizes at long range, where thepotential presumably varies more slowly.  Values of TOLAI in the range 1.1 - 1.3 are appropriate for in mostcalculations.<p> If, however, the control parameter TOLAI is set to be < 1, then, again <b>only</b> if<i>R</i> > RINCR,  theinterval sizes are adjusted using crude estimates of the error intoduced bythe linear approximation to the <i>W</i> matrix (see M. H. Alexander, J. Chem. Phys. <b>81</b>,4510).  These estimates aredesignated COFF and CDIAG.  The width of the next interval is adjustedaccording to the following alogrithm:<p> <tt><center>       DRNOW(n+1) = DRNOW(n) * (TOLAI/CMAX) ** (1/3)<p> </tt></center>where <tt>CMAX=max(COFF,CDIAG)</tt>. If CMAX < TOLAI, then the interval width is increased, ifCMAX > TOLAI, the interval width is decreased.<p>       In this case (TOLAI < 1) decreasing the value of TOLAI should increase the accuracy of theintegration, although there is no quantitive relation between the value ofTOLAI and the desired accuracy in the <i>S</i> matrix.  <p>The default value is TOLAI=1, which forces constant interval sizes in the AIRY propagation. <hr><img src=warningsmall.gif> Regardless of the sign of TOLAI, no change in the intervalwidth is made if <i>R</i> < RINCR<hr>Click <a href=params.html> here</a> for more information on reading in, changing, or saving the valuesof any parameter.<hr><a href=hibhelp.html><img src=up_arrow.gif border=0 align=middle></a>&#001;Return to <a href=hibhelp.html>Hibridon Help</a>
