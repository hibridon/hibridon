<TITLE>output</TITLE><h3><center><font color=#brown >Main Output File and Variable OUTPT</h3></center></font><hr> The Hibridon code writes all output, except for the specialized filesdiscussed in the in the <a href=files.html>JOB</a> help entry, to a main output file (fortranlogical unit 9, a sequential formatted file).  In addition some output isdirected to <tt>stdout</tt> (fortran logical unit 6).  The name of the main outputfile is initally set to <tt>Outpt</tt>.  This name can be changed by resettingthe variable OUT, as follows:<tt><ul>        OUT={outname}, </ul></tt>where <tt>{outname}</tt> is a character string (not in quotes).  This nameis converted internally to lower case, with the first character upper case. <br><img src=warningsmall.gif> On some machines existing output files will be overwritten unlessyou give them a new name.<hr><p>See also the help files <a href=input.html>INPUT</a>. <hr><a href=hibhelp.html><img src=up_arrow.gif border=0 align=middle></a> Return to <a href=hibhelp.html>Hibridon Help</a>
