<h3> <font color=brown>MOLSCAT, version 14</h3></font><hr>MOLSCAT is a code for quantum mechanical (coupled channel) solution of the      <strong>nonreactive     </strong> molecular scattering problem.      Code is implemented for various types of collision partners. In addition      to the essentially exact close coupling method several      approximate methods, including the  Coupled States and Infinite Order Sudden</a>      approximations, are provided.  The code is in near standard      FORTRAN 77 and has been ported to a large number of platforms.      The code was developed by Sheldon Green and Jeremy Hutson<p> For further information consult the MOLSCAT home page <a href=http://www.giss.nasa.gov/tools/molscat/><img src=linksmall.gif align=bottom border=1></a><P>or send an inquiry to <a href=mailto:J.M.Hutson@durham.ac.uk>Jeremy Hutson <img src=Envelope.gif width=16 height=10 border=1></a></a><hr>Return to <a href=hibhelp.html>Hibridon Help</a> <a href=hibhelp.html><img src=rightarrow.gif border=0 align=middle></a>
