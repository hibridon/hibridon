<TITLE>printc</TITLE><h3><center><font color=#brown >Command PRINTC</h3></center></font><hr>The command PRINTC allows you to print out a subset of previouslycalculated integral cross sections (in units of square Angstroms) which have been written to <a href=files.html>file</a><tt>{jobname}n.ics</tt>.  The subset of integral cross sections which will be printedcorresponds to all transitions out of levels for which the rotationalquantum number is specified in the array <a href=jout.html>JOUT</a> and for which theadditional quantum index is specified in the array <a href=indout.html>INDOUT</a>. The command linesyntax is<tt><ul>          PRINTC,{jobname},iprint,iaver,ienerg</tt></ul> where<ul>      <tt>{jobnam}:</tt>&#160; the jobname under which the integral cross sections                  have been stored as <tt>{jobname}n.ics</tt>.  Here <tt>n</tt> denotes the                  value of the parameter ienerg (see below).  Integral                  cross section (.ics) files can be generated by setting                  the flag <a href=prxsec.html>WRXSEC</a> = .true.  The default value                  of <tt>{jobnam}</tt> is the value of the jobname you have set with                  the instruction <ul><tt>JOB ={jobname}</ul></tt><p>                                  <img src=cautionsmall.gif>                 Note that for full close-coupling determinations of integral cross sections                 it is necessary to carry out calculationsfor both values of this parity (this is ensured by setting <tt><a href="jlpar.html">JLPAR</a>=0</tt>; see the <a href=jlpar.html>JLPAR</a> frame for more information)<p>If no value of <tt>{jobnam}</tt>has been set, thedefault value of                   <tt>{jobname}</tt> is <tt>Job</tt><p>     <tt>iprint:</tt>&#160; <ul>                 iprint < 0 if the subset of desired integral cross sections is to be                 printed to the file <tt>{jobname}n.xsc</tt><p>                 iprint .ge. 0, if the subset of desired integral cross sections is also                  to be printed to the main <a href=output.html>output</a> file<p>                 iprint > 0, if the list of channel energies is also to be printed to the                 main <a href=output.html>output</a> file.<p>                 The default value of iprint is 0<p></ul>      <tt>iaver:</tt>&#160; <ul>iaver = 0 if the full matrix of integral cross sections is to be                 printed.<p>                 iaver = 1 if the integral cross sections are to be summed over                 positive and negative values of the additional quantum                 index of the final state<p>                 iaver = 2 if the integral cross sections are to be summed and                 averaged over positive and negative values of the                  additional quantum index of the initial and final states<p>                  <img src=cautionsmall.gif> this summing and averaging is sure to work only if                 there is an even number of open levels with alternating                 values (positive and negative) of the quantum index<br>  The default value of iaver is 0</ul><p>      <tt>ienerg:</tt>&#160; The cardinal value of the energy for which the integral cross                 sections are to be computed. <i>i.e.</i> if ienerg = 2, then the                 second energy <i>S</i> matrix file <tt>{jobname}2.smt</tt> or second energy                 integral cross section file <tt>{jobname}2.ics</tt> are used.
