<TITLE>prxsec</TITLE><h3><center><font color=#brown >Flags PRXSEC and WRXSEC</h3></center></font><hr>If PRXSEC = .TRUE., then integral cross sections will be printed out atthe end of the regular output file.  Integral cross sections are obtained bysumming over all partial cross sections with<p><ul> <a href=jtot1.html>JTOT1</a> &#190;  <i>J<sub>tot</i></sub> &#190; <a href=jtot1.html>JTOT2</a><p></ul>inclusive.  If <a href=jtot1.html>JTOTD</a> > 1, a trapezoidal interpolation scheme is used toapproximate this sum.  The columns of the printed matrix of integral cross sections correspond to the initial state and the rows, to the final state. <p>In the case of <a href=coupledstates.html>CS</a> calculations the integral cross sections represent asum over all the values of the <a href=coupledstates.html>CS</a> projection index <i>nu</i> lying between <a href=numin.html>NUMIN</a> and<a href=numin.html>NUMAX</a>, inclusive.  Only transitions into and/or out of rotational levelswith <i>J</i> .le. <a href=numin.html>NUMAX</a> will be converged.  In general, cross sections for only these transitions are printed.  However, setting IPRINT = 2 forces printingof all the cross sections, even those which are not converged with respectto the sum over the projection index <i>nu</i>. <p>In the case of <a href=closecoupled>CC</a> calculations, to obtain integral cross sections summedover both values of the parity index <a href=jlpar.html>JLPAR</a>, set JLPAR = 0.<hr>The printing of integral cross sections to a separate file is controlledby the flag WRXSEC, as follows:<p>If WRXSEC = .TRUE., then integral cross sections will be printed out to aseparate file <tt>{jobname}n.ics</tt> where <tt>n</tt> designates the cardinal value of the energy,<i>e.g.</i> for the first energy the integral cross sections will be in the file<tt>{jobname}1.ics</tt>, etc.  Integral cross sections are computed exactly as described earlieron this page.<p>The contents of the file <tt>{jobname}n.ics</tt> can be examined or printed using thecommand <a href=printc.html>PRINTC</a>. <hr><a href=hibhelp.html><img src=up_arrow.gif border=0 align=middle></a>&#001;Return to <a href=hibhelp.html>Hibridon Help</a>
