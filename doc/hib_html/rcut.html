<TITLE>rcut</TITLE><h3><center><font color=#brown >Parameter RCUT</h3></center></font><hr>In a typical scattering calculation, a large channel basis is needed only at small values of <I>J</I><sub>tot</sub>.   As <I>J</I><sub>tot</sub> increases, the centrifugal  barrier prevents the collision partners from penetrating into the strong coupling region, so that the effective distortion of the asymptotic Hamiltonian is much less.  Considerable time can be saved by dropping channels as <I>J</I><sub>tot</sub> increases.<P>This is done in the Hibridon<font size=-2><sup>TM</sup></font> code by means of the parameter <tt>RCUT</tt>, as follows:<P>In the subroutine basis, the centrifugal barrier in each channel, evaluated at <I>R</I> = <tt>RCUT</tt>,<p><center>		<i>h</i><sup>2</sup> <I>l<sub>i</sub></I> (<I>l<sub>i</sub></I> + 1) / (2 &#181; <tt>RCUT</tt><sup>2</sup>)<p></center>		where <I>l<sub>i</sub></I> is the orbital angular momentum of the  i<sup><I>th</I></sup> channel,  is compared to the internal energy of the channel, <img src=eps12.gif align=bottom><I><sub>i</sub></I>. If the  centrifugal barrier at <I>R</I> = <tt>RCUT</tt> is greater than <img src=eps12.gif align=bottom><I><sub>i</sub></I>, then the channel is   still closed at <I>R</I> = <tt>RCUT</tt>.  If <I>any</I> of the channels which are open asymptotically are found to be   closed at <I>R</I> = <tt>RCUT</tt>, then these channels as well as all other closed   channels are dropped from the channel basis.<P>We have found this to be an effective and simple way of dropping    channels at large <I>J</I><sub>tot</sub>.  The rapidity  by which the channels are dropped is controlled by the magnitude of <tt>RCUT</tt>.  Obviously, if <tt>RCUT</tt> is taken equal to<A HREF="rendld.html"><tt>RENDAI</tt></A> - the ending point of the  integration - then no channels will everbe dropped.  A good rule of thumb is to chose initially a small value for <tt>RCUT</tt> in the range <tt>RENDAI/3</tt> to <tt>RENDAI/2</tt> and then increase <tt>RCUT</tt> only if necessary. <p> <img src=warning-32.png> In cases where the collision energy lies near (either above or below) the threshold for one (or more) channels (in other words near the point where a particular asymptotic state just becomes energetically allowed), accuracy may be lost be dropping channels.  In this case, set <tt>RCUT</tt> negative, which will  block the calculation from dropping any channels.    <font color=brown> By default it is probably best to set <tt>RCUT</tt> negative.</font>  <hr>Click <a href=params.html> here</a> for more information on reading in, changing, or saving the valuesof any parameter.<hr><a href=hibhelp.html><img src=up_arrow.gif border=0 align=middle></a>&#001;Return to <a href=hibhelp.html>Hibridon Help</a>
