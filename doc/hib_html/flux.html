<h3 class="c1">Command FLUX</h3>
</div>
<hr>
The command FLUX requests the determination of the collision or photodissociation flux as a function of <i>R</i> using using data stored during a previous calculation. For more details on the definition and determination of the flux see:
<p class="c3">M. H. Alexander, J. Chem. Phys. <b>95</b>, 8931 (1991); <b>96</b>, 6672 (1992). D. E. Manolopoulos and M. H. Alexander, J. Chem. Phys. <b>97</b>, 2527 (1992); M. H. Alexander, C. Rist, and D. E. Manolopoulos, J. Chem. Phys. <b>97</b>, 4836 (1992).</p>
<p>The command line syntax is</p>
<div class="c4"><tt>FLUX,{jobnam},IFLUX,{additional variables}</tt></div>
where
<div class="c4"><tt>{jobname}:</tt>&nbsp; the jobname under which the wavefunction information from the previous calculation is stored, as the file <tt>{jobname}.wfu</tt><br>
<img src="warningsmall.gif"> In order to create the <tt>{jobname}.wfu</tt> file, the previous calculation must have been carried out with the flags <a href="wavefl.html">WAVEFL</a>, <a href="airyfl.html">AIRYFL</a> and <a href="prsmat.html">WRSMAT</a> all set TRUE.
<p><tt>IFLUX =</tt> &nbsp;</p>
<div class="c4">1:&nbsp; for a determination of the fluxes in the diabatic (asymptotic) basis
<p>&minus;1:&nbsp; for a determination of the fluxes in the locally adiabatic basis</p>
<p>2:&nbsp; for a determination of the adiabatic energies (see also the <a href="eadiab.html">EADIAB</a> command</p>
<p>&minus;2:&nbsp; for fluxes summed over the sign of the additional channel index</p>
<p>3:&nbsp; for fluxes in coordinate space</p>
<p>4:&nbsp; for determination of the transformation matrix <b>C</b><i>(R)</i>, defined in Eq. (6) of the help file describing the <a href="closecoupled.html">close coupling method</a></p>
</div>
</div>
<hr>
If IFLUX = &minus;1,1, or &minus;2 then the <tt>{additional variables}</tt> are <tt>THRESH, IPRINT, DAMP, INITIAL-J, INITIAL-L,</tt> and <tt>INITIAL-IND</tt>. These are defined as follows:
<div class="c4">
<p><tt>THRESH:</tt>&nbsp; If the local wavevector in any channel is less than <tt>THRESH</tt>, then the wavefunction component associated with this channel is killed off. The default value of <tt>THRESH</tt> is 0 for scattering calculations, and -1.e+9 for photodissociation calculations</p>
<p><tt>IPRINT:</tt>&nbsp; Normally, fluxes are not printed inside of any energetically closed region. To print these out set <tt>IPRINT</tt> not equal to zero. The default value of <tt>IPRINT</tt> is 0 for scattering and 1 for photodissociation</p>
<p><tt>DAMP:</tt>&nbsp; the damping factor for closed channel components (the default value is one)</p>
<p><tt>INITIAL-J:</tt>&nbsp; the rotational angular momentum of the initial channel</p>
<p><tt>INITIAL-L:</tt>&nbsp; the orbital angular momentum of the initial channel</p>
<p><tt>INITIAL-IND:</tt>&nbsp; the value of the additional index of the initial channel</p>
<p><b>In addition</b>, channel fluxes are printed out ONLY for those channels which are specified in the arrays JOUT and INDOUT.</p>
</div>
<hr>
<img src="cautionsmall.gif"> For a photodissociation calculation it is not nessary to specify <tt>THRESH, IPRINT, DAMP, INITIAL-J, INITIAL-L,</tt> or <tt>INITIAL-IND</tt>. In this case the command line should be
<div class="c4"><tt>FLUX,JOB,IFLUX</tt></div>
<hr>
If IFLUX = 2 then the adiabatic energies will be printed. This command works different from <a href="eadiab.html">EADIAB</a>. The only adiabatic energies which are written out are those which correlate adiabatically at large R with the internal states of the collision partners whose rotational angular momenta and additional indices are specified in the arrays <a href="jout.html">JOUT</a> and <a href="indout.html">INDOUT</a>. Specifically, adiabatic energies are given for each channel for which
<div class="c1"><tt>J(i) = JOUT(i)</tt></div>
and for which the vector element <tt>INDOUT(i)</tt> corresponds to the quantum number L and the extra index of the desired channel packed into a single array as follows:
<div class="c1"><tt>INDOUT(i) = sign[IND(i)] x [100 L(i) + | IND(i) | ]</tt></div>
<hr>
If IFLUX = 3 then the <tt>{additional variables}</tt> are <tt>NR, RMIN, DR, THRESH, IPRINT,</tt> and <tt>DAMP</tt>, where
<div class="c4"><tt>NR:</tt>&nbsp; | <tt>NR</tt> | is the number of coordinate space points at which the flux is to be determined
<div class="c4">if <tt>NR</tt> &gt; 0, then the calculated flux is a sum over the flux associated with all channels with <b>positive</b> values of the additional index
<p>if <tt>NR</tt> &lt; 0, then the calculated flux is a sum over the flux associated with all channels with <b>negative</b> values of the additional index</p>
</div>
<tt>RMIN:</tt>&nbsp; Minimum value of the internal coordinate <i>r</i>
<p><tt>DR:</tt>&nbsp; Step size in the internal coordinate <i>r</i></p>
<p><tt>THRESH:</tt>&nbsp; as defined above</p>
<p><tt>IPRINT:</tt>&nbsp; as defined above</p>
<p><tt>DAMP:</tt>&nbsp; as defined above</p>
</div>
<img src="cautionsmall.gif"> Coordinate state fluxes will be determined for all values of the internal coordinate <i>r</i> ranging from RMIN to RMIN+(NR -1) DR
<hr>
If IFLUX = 4 then <tt>{additional variables}</tt> designates
<div class="c4"><tt>nstate:</tt>&nbsp; The number of states for which the asymptotic &rarr; locally adiabatic transformation matrix is to be printed out
<p><tt>R<sub>min</sub>:</tt>&nbsp; The minimum value of <i>R</i> at which the asymptotic &rarr; locally adiabatic transformation matrix is to be printed</p>
<p><tt>&delta;R:</tt>&nbsp; The step size</p>
<p><tt>R<sub>max</sub>:</tt>&nbsp; The maximum value of <i>R</i> at which the asymptotic &rarr; locally adiabatic transformation matrix is to be printed</p>
</div>
If the variable <tt>&delta;R</tt> is &le; 0, then the transformation matrix is printed out just for <tt>R=R<sub>min</sub></tt>. Otherwise, the transformation matrix is printed out for <tt>R=R<sub>min</sub>:&delta;R:R<sub>max</sub></tt>.
<p><img src="cautionsmall.gif"> <tt>nstate</tt> cannot exceed 12, it will be truncated if the input value exceeds 12.</p>
<hr>
<img src="warningsmall.gif"> Fluxes are determined at all values of <i>R</i> lying between <a href="rendld.html">RENDLD</a> and <a href="rendld.html">RENDAI</a>, with the grid size and spacing controlled by the same parameters which govern the AIRY integration, namely <a href="spac.html">SPAC</a>, <a href="fstfac.html">FSTFAC</a>, <a href="tolai.html">TOLAI</a>, and <a href="tolai.html">RINCR</a>.
<p><img src="warningsmall.gif"> The determination of collision and photodissociation fluxes should be attempted only if you have a sophisticated understanding of the time-independent quantum description of molecular collisions.</p>
