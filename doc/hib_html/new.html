In addition to several important bug fixes, version 4.2 of the 
Hibridon code has the following new features:
<ul>
<li>An updated module (<tt>hitensor.f</tt>) for the determination of tensor cross sections
and <i>M</i>-dependent cross sections.
<p>
<li>A component (<tt>hibound.f</tt>) for the determination of weakly-bound complexes involving
atomic and/or molecular radicals, provided that the interaction potential can be
expanded in the same <a href="potlist.html">form</a> as used for molecular scattering.
<p>
<li>An option, when linking the code, to exclude certain functions in exchange for an
ability to handle a larger number of channels<p>
<li>Documentation of the option allowing the <a href="restart.html">restart</a> of a long-running calculation after
a power failure or system crash
</ul>
The on-line (<tt>doc/hibrid.hlp</tt>) and .html-based (<tt>doc/index.html</tt>) help facilities have been
revised to include help on these items as well as examples.
<p>Version 4.2 of the code includes:
<ul>
<li>Extension to Apple's G4 and G5 processor workstations running OSX 10.3 (Panther).  In order to compile
and link on Apple workstations, you will need to have:
<ul>
<li>The  <a href=http://www.absoft.com/xlf/index.htm>IBM XL Fortran Compiler (XLF)</a> available from <a href=http://www.absoft.com/xlf.html> Absoft</a>
<p>
<li>The Mac OS X Developer Tools package, which includes gcc Version 3.3. 
The package is available from the Apple Developer Connection  <a href=http://connect.apple.com/>
Website</a>.  In particular, Xcode Tools v1.0 or later is required. <p>
</ul>
<li>Replacement of many matrix-matrix: routines with calls to version 3.0 
<a href=http://www.netlib.org/lapack/lug/lapack_lug.html>Lapack</a> routines. 
</ul>
<hr>
In addition to the changes mentioned above for version 4.2, version 4.3 of the Hibridon code has 
 the following new features:
<ul>
<li>The possibility of doing calculations at up to 25 different collision <a href=energ.html>energies</a>, which
may be chosen on a regularly spaced linear grid.
<p>
<li>Two possibilities for formatting the integral cross section files arising from the commands 
<a href=printc.html><tt>PRINTC</tt></a> and <a href=intcrs.html><tt>INTCRS</tt></a>.
<p>
<li>A new command, <a href=sysconf.html><tt>SYSCONF</tt></a> (and an equivalent shell command <a href=sysconf.html><tt>hib_sysconfig</tt></a>) which prints out the key details
of your current operating system.
</ul>
The on-line (<tt>doc/hibrid.hlp</tt>) and .html-based (<tt>doc/index.html</tt>) help facilities have been
revised to include help on these items as well as examples.

<p>Version 4.3 of the code has been developed for (and tested on) the following platforms:
<ul>
<li>Apple's G4 and G5 processor workstations running OSX 10.3 (Panther) and 10.4 (Tiger).  In order to compile
and link on Apple G4 and G5 workstations, you will need to have:
<ul>
<li>The  <a href=http://www.absoft.com/Products/Compilers/Fortran/Mac/XLF/xlf.html>IBM XL Fortran Compiler (XLF)
</a> available from <a href=http://www.absoft.com/Products/Compilers/Fortran/Mac/XLF/xlf.html> Absoft</a>  <img src=warningsmall.gif> <font color=red> Note, despite the indication
on Absoft's <a href=http://www.absoft.com/Products/Compilers/Fortran/Mac/XLF/xlf.html>web page</a> that IBM XL Fortran v8.1 for Mac OS X is not supported on Mac OS X Version 10.4 - Tiger, 
the Hibridon package does install, compile, and execute correctly under OSX 10.4.10 and 10.4.11 with XLF8.1. </font><font color=red>  Hibridon is no longer actively
maintained on Apple PowerPC platforms.</font>
<p>
<li>The current version of Mac OS X Developer Tools package. 
Under OS X 10.5 and 10.6 this package is available from the Apple Developer Connection  <a href=http://connect.apple.com/>
Website</a>.  Under System 10.7 (Lion) the Xcode Tools package is available directly from the <a href=http://www.apple.com/mac/app-store/>App Store</a><p>
. <p>
</ul>
<li>Apple Intel platforms running OSX 10.4 (Tiger) and 10.5.1 (Leopard).  In order to compile
and link on Apple Intel platforms, you will need to have:
<ul>
<li>The  
Intel <a href=http://www.intel.com/cd/software/products/asmo-na/eng/compilers/267426.htm>Fortran Compiler</a>  (ifort).<p>
<li>The Mac OS X Developer Tools package. 
The package is available from the Apple Developer Connection  <a href=http://connect.apple.com/>
Website</a>.  In particular, the current version of Xcode Tools is required. 
Under System 10.7 (Lion) this is available directly from the <a href=http://www.apple.com/mac/app-store/>App Store</a><p>

</ul>
<li>Intel Xeon (x86) based platforms running under Linux (installation under Red Hat v. 4 has 
been explicitly tested). 
Compilation, linking, and execution of Hibridon v. 4.3 has been successful with
<ul>
<li>The Intel ifort compiler and  MKL mathematics library
<li>The Portland Group pgf95 compiler and ACML mathematics library
</ul>
</ul>
<p>
The major computational effort in calculations with the Hibridon code is associated with
a series of matrix-matrix (BLAS3) operations (matrix inversions, diagonizations, and multiplications), which
are carried out by calls to the <a href=www.netlib.org/lapack>LAPACK</a> routines DGERF, DGETRI, DSYEVR, and DGEMM. 
The latest version
of Intel's (<a href=http://support.intel.com/support/performancetools/libraries/mkl/>MKL</a> math library as well as
of Apple's veclib (/System/Library/Frameworks/Accelerate.framework/Versions/Current) include, automatically,
parallelized versions of these LAPACK routines, so that considerable performance enhancement can be
achieved when running on multi-cpu, multi-core workstations.  A more in-depth discussion is given 
on a separate <a href=parallel.html>page</a>.
