<TITLE>batch</TITLE><h3><center><font color=#brown >Batch Mode and Background Execution</h3></center></font><hr>To run the Hibridon<font size=-2><sup>TM</sup></font> package in batch mode, set up a run stream with BATCH asthe first line.  This supresses the input line query <font color=browm><tt>Hibridon></tt></font>. All othercommands will be read from the run stream and executed.   An example wouldbe: <ul>       <tt>BATCH</tt><br>       <tt>PRINTS,job1</tt>         <ul> print, into the log file, <i>S</i> matrices from the                            file <tt>Job1.smt</tt> (see the help file for the command                            <a href=prints.html>PRINTS</a>)</ul>       <tt>INP={input}</tt>          <ul>read parameters and flags from file {input}</ul>       <tt>OUT={outfile}</tt>        <ul>file {outfile} will be opened as the output file</ul>       <tt>JOB={jobname}</tt>        <ul><i>S</i> matrices, partial cross sections, integral                            cross sections will be saved in files                            <tt>{jobname}.ext</tt> where <tt>ext =.smt, pcs, ics,</tt> etc</ul>       <tt>RSTART=3.5</tt>           <ul>reset the parameter <a href=rendld.html>RSTART</a></ul>       <tt>RUN</tt>                  <ul>run a scattering calculation with the new                            parameter set</ul>       <tt>EXIT</tt>  </ul>Note that on many systems it may be necessary to specify a pathname as wellas a file name for <tt>{input}, {outfile}, {jobname}</tt> unless the correspondingfiles are located in your current directory. <p>Alternatively, running scattering calculations in the background can be accomplishedby first defining a command file which contains the input commands.  Following the aboveexample, we would define a command file <tt>runner.com</tt>, say, which would containthe following lines <ul>       <tt>INP={input}<br>        PRINTS,job1<br>              OUT={outfile}<br>       JOB={jobname}<br>       RSTART=3.5<br>              RUN<br>               EXIT</tt></ul>The, after making the command file executable<p><ul><tt>chmod +x runner.com</tt></ul>You would execute the command<p><ul><tt>hib_xx < runner.com > runner.log &</tt></ul>Where <tt>hib_xx</tt> is the name of your executable code (see the <a href=linking.html>LINKING</a>help file), and the file <tt>runner.log</tt> will contain a log of the execution.<hr><a href=hibhelp.html><img src=up_arrow.gif border=0 align=middle></a> Return to <a href=hibhelp.html>Hibridon Help</a>
