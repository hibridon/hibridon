</center></font><hr>
If NOPRIN = .TRUE., most printing is suppressed.  This is useful in
production runs.  Note that setting NOPRIN = .TRUE. also sets the print
control parameter IPRINT to -1.
<hr>      If CHLIST = .TRUE., the channels included are listed at
every value of <i>J<sub>tot</sub></i> (or <img src=lbarsmall.gif align=bottom>).  If CHLIST = .FALSE., then the channels are
listed in the output file  only at the first value of <i>J<sub>tot</sub></i>.  <p>

Note that the flag CHLIST controls printing the channel list
only in the output file.  The only way to print out the list of channels on your terminal screen is to set the flag <a href=bastst.html>BASTST</a> = .TRUE., in which
case the job will cease after the list of channels is printed, and await a new command.
<p>When the number of channels is large, you
will certainly want to suppress printing the list of channels.
