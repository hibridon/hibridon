what we already have:

    cmake build
    changing kmax no longer requires compilation
    most common blocks have been converted into modules
    free form instead of fixed form
    standard preprocessing instead of custom (ftconv)
    Continuous integration

overall goal: prevent user from changing its habits after hibridon 5:

    don't change the way the user builds the code
    the user won't have to change his potential code for hibridon'release after version 5

constraints:

    retrocompatibility with old potential subroutines (would need to double check with @frantholi @pdagdigian)? That would mean:
        common blocks.
        no refactoring of potentials into classes ?
    don't change input files

potential candidates:

    IMPORTANT no more common blocks
    IMPORTANT refactor potentials into classes (objectives: easier to write potentials, less code to write)
    WOULD_BE_NICE refactor bases into classes
    IMPORTANT new logo
    MANDATORY move all doc to github (githubwiki or githubpages).. (would need to double check with @frantholi @pdagdigian)
    MANDATORY update documentation
    MANDATORY clean changelog
    MAYBE change hibridon version numbering hibridon 2022 instead of hibridon 5
    WOULD_BE_NICE output files stored in hdf5 format
    IMPORTANT remove hardcoded kv2max factor (hardcoded with the value 50 at the moment), either:
    a. by adding a kv2max_factor command line argument (easy and dirty route)
    b. by automatically adjust the size of v2 array (hibridon automatically computes kv2max)
