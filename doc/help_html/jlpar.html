JLPAR is the parameterwhich selects the parity of the channels which are included in a CC calculation. <p>If JLPAR=+1 or -1, thenfor molecules in electronic states of odd multiplicity (integer spin) onlythose channels for which<p><center> <i>e</i>(-1) <i><sup>J - S - s + L - Jtot</sup></i> = JLPAR</center><p> are included in the channel basis.  For molecules in electronic states ofeven multiplicity (half-integer spin) only those channels for which <p><center> <i>e</i>(-1)<sup><i>J - S - s + L - Jtot - </i>1/2</sup> = JLPAR</center><p> are included in the channel basis.  Here <p>&#160;&#160;&#160;<i>e</i> = symmetry index of molecular state in Hund's case (a) (e = +1 or -1)<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;<i>S</i>  = total spin<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;<i>s</i>  = 1 for sigma-minus states, 0 otherwise<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;<i>L</i>  = orbital angular momentum<p> <img src=cautionsmall.gif> In general, in the CC formulation, calculations for both values of JLPAR must be performed to determine integral and/ordifferential cross sections.  Setting JLPAR = 0 in a <a href=closecoupled.html>CC</a> calculation will ensure that the calculationis done first for JLPAR = 1, and subsequently for JLPAR = -1.  <p><img src=cautionsmall.gif> The parameter JLPAR is ignored in <a href=coupledstates.html>coupled states</a> calculations.</table></center><hr>Go to:<p><center><a href=closecoupled.html>Close-Coupled Equations</a> | <a href=params.html>Parameters</a> | <a href=coupledstates.html>Coupled States</a> | <a href=hibhelp.html> HibridonHelp
