<TITLE>New</TITLE><h3><center><font color=#brown >New Features</h3></center></font><hr>In addition to several important bug fixes, version 4.1.5 of the Hibridon code has the following new features:<ul><li>An updated module (<tt>hitensor.f</tt>) for the determination of tensor cross sectionsand <i>M</i>-dependent cross sections.<p><li>A component (<tt>hibound.f</tt>) for the determination of weakly-bound complexes involvingatomic and/or molecular radicals, provided that the interaction potential can beexpanded in the same <a href="potlist.html">form</a> as used for molecular scattering.<p><li>An option, when linking the code, to exclude certain functions in exchange for anability to handle a larger number of channels<p><li>Documentation of the option allowing the <a href="restart.html">restart</a> of a long-running calculation aftera power failure or system crash</ul>The on-line (<tt>doc/hibrid.hlp</tt>) and .html-based (<tt>doc/index.html</tt>) help facilities have beenrevised to include help on these items as well as examples.<p>Version 4.2 of the code includes:<ul><li>Extension to Apple's G4 and G5 processor workstations running OSX 10.3 (Panther).  In order to compileand link on Apple workstations, you will need to have:<ul><li>The new <a href=http://www.absoft.com/xlf/index.htm>IBM XL Fortran Compiler (XLF)</a> available from <a href=http://www.absoft.com/xlf.html> Absoft</a><p><li>The Mac OS X Developer Tools package, which includes gcc Version 3.3. The package is available from the Apple Developer Connection  <a href=http://connect.apple.com/>Website </a>.  Xcode Tools v1.0 or later is required. <p></ul><li>Replacement of many matrix-matrix: routines with calls to version 3.0 <a href=http://www.netlib.org/lapack/lug/lapack_lug.html>Lapack</a> routines. </ul><hr>Go to<center><a href="boundstates.html">Bound states</a> | <a href="tenxsc.html">Tensor Cross Sections</a> | <a href="mrcrs.html">M-dependent Cross Sections</a> |  <a href=memory.html>Memory Limits</a> |<a href=restart.html>Restarting</a> | <a href=linking.html>Linking</a> | <a href=hibhelp.html>Hibridon Help</a>
