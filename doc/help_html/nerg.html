<TITLE>nerg</TITLE><h3><center><font color=#brown >Parameter NERG</h3></center></font><hr> NERG is the number of total energies at which the calculation is tobe performed.  Both the log-derivative and AIRY propagation aresignificantly faster for the second and subsequent energies.  Thus if crosssections are desired over a range of energies, it is advantageous to setNERG > 1.<p>The maximum value of NERG is controlled by a PARAMETER statement in thesubroutine LOGAIR (himain.f)and can not exceed 10 (because of restrictions imposed by the length ofthe names of the logical units reserved for storing the partial andintegral cross sections and selected <i>S</i>-matrix elements).  If NERG>1, thenthree scratch files (units 10-12) are opened to store the required energyindependent matrices as well as the channel quantum numbers. <p>The value of NERG can be changed with the command<p><ul><tt>           NERG={newvalue}<p></ul></tt> If <tt>{newvalue}</tt> is larger than the value of NERG currently stored, then youwill be warned to increase accordingly the array of energies at which thecalculations are to be performed.  This can be done with the command<p><ul><tt>           ENERG={energy1},{energy2}...{energyn}\<p></ul></tt> where <tt>n</tt> is the new value of NERG.  The string of input values <b>must</b> beterminated with a backslash if other input occurs on the same line.<hr><a href=hibhelp.html><img src=up_arrow.gif border=0 align=middle></a>&#001;Return to <a href=hibhelp.html>Hibridon Help</a>
