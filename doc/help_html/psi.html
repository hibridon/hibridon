<TITLE>psi</TITLE><h3><center><font color=#brown >Command PSI</h3></center></font><hr>The command PSI  allows you to determine the scattering wavefunction from data storedduring a previous calculation.  Specifically this command will determine andwrite out one column of the <b>F</b><i>(R)</i> matrix defined in the help filewhich describes the <a href=closecoupled.html>close coupling</a> method. <p>    The command line syntax isline is<tt><ul>            PSI,{jobname},,INITIAL-J,INITIAL-L,INITIAL-IND</tt></ul>where<ul>       <tt>{jobname}:</tt>&#160; the jobname under which the wavefunction informationfrom the previous calculation is stored, as the file <tt>{jobname}.wfu</tt> <img src=warningsmall.gif> In order to create the <tt>{jobname}.wfu</tt> file, the previous calculation must havebeen carried out with the flags <a href=wavefl.html>WAVEFL</a> and <a href=airyfl.html>AIRYFL</a>both set .true.  <p><tt>INITIAL-J:</tt>&#160;       the rotational angular momentum of the incoming channel<p><tt>INITIAL-L:</tt>&#160;       the orbital angular momentum of the incoming channel<p><tt>INITIAL-IND:</tt>&#160;     the value of additional index for the incoming channel<p></ul>The INITIAL-J, INITIAL-L, and INITIAL-IND indices specify which column of the <b>F</b><i>(R)</i> matrixis selected.  In addition, the only components (row elements) of this columnwhich are written out are those for which the rotational angular momenta and additional indices are specified in the arrays <a href=jout.html>JOUT</a> and <a href=indout.html>INDOUT</a><p>All selected components of the scattering wavefunctions are written to the file<tt>{jobname}.psi</tt>.  The output is two successive matrices, corresponding, respectively,to the real and imaginary parts of <b>F</b><i>(R)</i>.  The rows correspondto the successive values of <i>R</i> and the columns, to the components of <b>F</b><i>(R)</i>which have been selected as described in the preceding paragraph.<p><img src=warningsmall.gif> The wavefunction is determined at all values of <i>R</i> lyingbetween <a href=rendld.html>RSTART</a> and <a href=rendld.html>RENDAI</a>, with thegrid size and spacing controlled by the same parameters which govern the LOGD and AIRY integration, namely<a href=spac.html>SPAC</a>, <a href=fstfac.html>FSTFAC</a>, <a href=tolai.html>TOLAI</a>, and <a href=tolai.html>RINCR</a>.In the output file <tt>{jobname}.psi</tt>the points that correspond to the AIRY integrationrange (RENDLD < <i>R</i> < RENDAI) are designated with <b>negative</b> value of <i>R</i>.<p><img src=warningsmall.gif> It is essential that <a href=spac.html>SPAC</a> be signficantly less than the DeBrogliewavelength (which can be determined with the command <a href=debrogli.html>DEBROGLI</a>)is order to get a meaningful representation of the wavefunction.<hr>Go to:<center><a href=commands.html>Commands</a> | <a href=psi.ex.html> An example of this command | <a href=examples.html>Examples</a> | <a href=hibhelp.html>Hibridon Help</a><br></center>
