to migrate to release 4.3, you should download the upgraded tar file for the 
complete package from the website
     www.chem.umd.edu/groups/alexander/hibridon/hib43

and follow the installation instructions contained on the webpage
     www.chem.umd.edu/groups/alexander/hibridon/hib43/install.html

to retain a copy of any previous versions, you may wish to
carry out the intall in a new main hibridon directory.
