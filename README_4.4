The following changes have been made in bringing hibridon 4.3
to release level 4.4

11/13     Added routines ofr collision of 1D/3P atom with atom
10/13     Symmetric top basis routines (bastp, bastp1) now have capability
          to molecules with equivalent spin 1 nuclei, e.g. CD3 and ND3
6/13      Added built-in 2pi--1sigma molecule-molecule basis, ibasty=20
          (hiba1sg, hiba2pi1sg, hisystem also modified)
6/13      Two functions, is_twomol() and is_j12() added in hiba1sg, to check 
          if a basis type (ibasty) is a moleule-molecule basis, and if it 
          requires a j12 array to complete the description of the channel
          basis.  Statements checking these in various files modified accordingly.  
          (So that when adding a new basis various I/O and cross sections 
          routines do not need to be changed.)
6/13      Hibound routine rewritten, now uses dynamic allocation, and 
          provides a simple wave vector analysis when wavefl=true.  It
          calculates only (-tolai) bound states if tolai<0.
6/13      Twomol is now passed to the basis routine.
6/13      Routines tf3jm0, tf3j, tj6j and tf9j routines added to hituil. These 
          functions take (integer) 2j, 2m as parameters.  The 3j and 6j functions 
          are faster than the xf versions (because conversion between real 
          number and integers is not fast and not so reliable).
6/13      Eliminate superfluous nlami array in basis routines baastp, bach2x,
          basyp, bastp1, bastpln
6/13      Dynamically allocate memory for arrays etc. in hitrnprt module
6/13      Dynamically allocate memory for arrays etc. in hiprsbr module
          and added sinqr routine to hiiolib_f (to determine max jtot and
          max channel length)
4/13      Added prsbr module to compute pressure broadening cross sections
3/13      Revised bah3p basis routine for the calculation of cross sections.
          Shifted zero of energy so that lowest level has eint = 0.
3/13      Revised bah2p basis routine for the calculation of cross sections.
          Shifted zero of energy so that lowest level has eint = 0.
11/12     Added common block conlamp to avoid duplicate use of lamnum
11/12     Increased size of jmx to 90m and sizes of lbufs and lbuflb, in partens
11/12     Rewrote hitrnprt.f so that all transport cross sections computed
          with a single command
9/12      Increased size of jout array to 50
9/12      Increased maximum size of asymmetric top basis expansion
9/12      Took care of problem with ibasty=4 and 19 basis types in 
          sigk subroutine in hitensor
9/12      Increased lengths of buffers in partens common block
4/12      Renomed duplicate variable definitions in hisystem
4/12      pot_nh3h2_2009 no longer writes to units that are not opened.
4/12      Corrected the subroutine in hisystem.f that writes input files for 
          bastpln
4/12      New interface to eadiab.  The original interface can be accessed 
          from the flux command.
4/12      Allow writing only adiabatic energies to wfu files when WRSMAT set 
          false.  Backward compatibility is lost since WRSMAT has to be set 
          true for flux/psi calculations.  A couple of input files in the 
          test have been modified.
4/12      Simplify the del function in hiutil.f (used by f3j0 and f6j).  
          This significantly improves the performance of the bastpln 
          basis subroutine.
4/12      Removed cf9j in hibastpln.f which calculates 9-j symbols for 
          integers but take double precision numbers as input.  
          The function is never called and can be substituted with 
          existing f9j and xf9j functions.
4/12      Moved f9j routine from hibastpln.f to hiutil.f
4/12      Fixed bug in wrhead subroutine (corrected for alignment)
4/12      Revised for stream I/O of wfu files
2/12      Implemented calculation of differential cross sections
          for molecule-molecule collisions (ibasty=9)
1/12      Moved dlmo and pm0 routines from hibrid3.f to hiutil.f
1/12      Fixed problem of calculation of elastic cross sections
          for molecule-molecule collisions with INTCRS
1/12      J12 now printed out for molecule-molecule collisions
          when PRINTS called
1/12      Replaced buffering s-matrix i/o routines with
          streaming i/o routines (hibridon now requires ifort compiler)
1/12      Time given to nearest second, but still works if date changes
1/12      Last line "quit/exit" now optional in a .com file
1/12      Added Q. Ma aa a contributor
12/11     Promoted P. Dagdigian from contributor to author
12/11     Increased nchtop to 1000 in wavewr
12/11     Increase kmxbas to 19 to accommodate more basis routines
12/11     Added basgpi1 basis routine - to determine angular coupling
          potential for collisional transfer between a 2sigma state 
          and one or more vibrational levels in a 2pi state (no
          isolated-molecule mixing of the sigma and pi states)
11/11     Half-integral j's now printed out with intcrs command
11/11     Added bastp1 basis routine - to determine angular coupling
          potential for collision of symmetric top molecule with no
          inversion splitting (like CH3)
10/11     Added calculation of tensor differential cross sections
          in the geometric apse frame
08/11     Added module to compute transport cross sections
08/11     Included inversion splitting is symmetric top energies and
          changed mothod of selecting rotational levels (jmax, emax)
          in bastpln basis routine
08/11     Included inversion splitting is symmetric top energies and
          changed mothod of selecting rotational levels (jmax, emax)
          in bastp basis routine
05/11     Added module to compute cross sections for mixed singlet-triple
          states, e.g. CH3 X3B1 - a1A1 collisions
03/11     Added calculation of tensor differential cross sections
          in the helicity frame
01/11     Modified method of calculation of hyperfine-resolvec cross sections
12/10     Commented out diagnostic print statement in diffcrs
12/10     Added bach2x basis routine - to determine angular coupling
          potential for collision of CH2(X3B1) in a (0,v2,0) bender
          level (non-rigid molecule)
07/10     Increased size of jout array in common block cosout
09/09     Added asymmetric top basis
