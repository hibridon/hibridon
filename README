Announcing the Hibridon© package for solution of the close-coupled
equations for inelastic molecular scattering.  This package combines two
sophisticated propagation algorithms.  A complete on-line, html-based help
facility is available. The Hibridon© package also allows the calculation of
photo-dissociation cross sections, the determination of collisional or
photodissociation fluxes, and the determination of energies and
wavefunctions for weakly-bound complexes.  The latest version (4) of 
Hibridon© greatly simplifies access by unsophisticated users and the 
ease of on-line parameter optimization.

installation instructions for Hibridon 4, release 4.1

at present this code has been verified on the following platforms:

rs/6000 aix 3.2.5 or 4.1.x
sgi irix 5.2 and 5.3
hp/9000 series 9.01, 9.02, 9.03, 10.01
dec alpha OSF v3.2
SunOS v2 rel. 4.1.4

to obtain and install the hibridon code
  follow instructions on the Hibridon home page
  http://www-mha.umd.edu/~mha/hibridon

OR

b.  use anonymous ftp from the site mha-ibm1.umd.edu
    i.  to obtain the binary file pub/hibrid/hibrid.tar.Z
    ii. to obtain the ascii file pub/hibrid/hibrid.tar.Z.uu
        in this case, uudecode the file before going to step c.

c.  create a main hibridon directory

d.  move the compressed tar archive into this directory

e.  uncompress and unpack the tar archive
    zcat hibrid.tar.Z |tar -xvf -

f.  extend your PATH variable to include the bin subdirectory
    of the main hibridon directory:

g.  verify that your PATH variable includes the bin directory

h.  be sure you read the license agreement before continuing


to compile all source code run bin/makefirst and then bin/makeobj
this also creates the on-line help executable: bin/hib_help

more detailed information is available by:

1.  running the on-line help program hib_help

2.  consulting the Hibridon home page
    http://www-mha.umd.edu/~mha/hibridon

3.  using your own web browser to consult your own copy of the
    Hibridon .html help facility using the initial target
    (in the Hibridon tree) doc/hib_html/index.html
         the .html help facility works best if your browser supports
         Netscape 3.0's "frames"
