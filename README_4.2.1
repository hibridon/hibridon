The following changes have been made in bringing hibridon 4.1.5
to relase level 4.2.1:
9/1/06    added nelib spline.f and seval.f to hipotutil
7/25/06   hiba2pi.f changed so that ntop=n always in bound state calculations
7/21/06   hiba2pi.f comment at the beginning of vlm2pi changed to indicate
          reference to correction given by G.C. Corey and M. H. Alexander, JCP 85, 5652 (1986)
6/10/06   changed to correct cs centrifugal barrier for bound state
          1sig (hiba1sg.f) and 2sig (hiba2sg.f)
          changed hibound.f to write out size of total basis
          changed hiiolib to reset numax=numin in bound state problems
             if CS flag=true and if numin>numax in input
6/9/06    added -lSystemStubs to makeconfig for Darwin OS X 10.4
4/11/06   changed makeconfig to allow for aix5/xlf8.1 on powerpc_4
          changed makeobj to use cc for hiunix rather than xlc
10/25/05  changed call in hibound from dsygv to dsygvd - much faster.
          change kaux3 in himain.t
10/24/05  changed himain.t, hibound:  error in eigenvalues for bound state problem
          corrected
10/20/05  changed hinput, hisystem, hiba1sg to allow a 15th basis type:  
          2P atom with a possibly heteronuclear diatomic
3/15/05   wavevectors in angstrom in hibrid1.f - conversion factor corrected
4/11/04   mnscript & vscript changed to allow four-element machine type from 
          machine.exe
4/11/04   makeconfig changed for PA8000/HPUX11.0
4/7/04    hibrid3.f changed so that rles works on aix machines
4/6/04    small changes to makehib and makepot
4/6/04    small format change in prsgpi (hibrid2.f)
4/4/04    change makepot to eliminate adding hiiolib.o in link
2/29/04   maketar changed 
2/29/04   copyright updated

2/24/04   replace remaining "call abort" with "stop"
2/24/04   change ftconv.exe to ftconv_hib.exe to avoid conflict with
          molpro
2/24/04   all "cstart mac"'s eliminated
2/24/04   rles changed to call lapack routines dgetrf and dgetrs
2/24/04   call to tqlrat in wavevc replaced by call to dsyevr
2/23/04   eigenvalue/eigenvector call in potent replaced by call to dsyevr
2/23/04   maketar, makeconfig updated
2/23/04   hibound corrected so that call to lapack dsygv is made
2/23/04   minor typo corrected in /bin/runtest
2/22/04   calls to smxinv replaced with call to syminv for matrix
          inversion, this calls lapack dsytrf and dsytri
12/28/03  himain and himatrix changed to allow call to lapack dspev for
          matrix diagonalization in MacOSX version
12/28/03  hibrid1.f changed to allow call to dgemm in dtrans instead
          of mxma in MacOSX version
12/28/03  hiiolib.f changed to ensure that sratch files for cs
          calculations are closed before they are opened
12/27/03  makeconfig and makemachine changed for MacOSX 10.3.2 with xlf 8.1beta

to migrate to release 4.2, you should download the upgraded tar file for the 
complete package from the website
