to migrate to release 4.1.4, you should download by anonymous ftp the 
upgraded tar file for the complete package
         mha-ibm1.umd.edu:/pub/hibrid/hibrid.tar.Z
    or
         mha-ibm1.umd.edu:/pub/hibrid/hibrid.tar.Z.uu

    and follow the installation instructions contained in the file
         mha-ibm1.umd.edu:/pub/hibrid/README

to retain a copy of any previous versions, you may wish to
